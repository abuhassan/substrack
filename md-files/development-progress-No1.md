## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Backend**: Server-side rendering and API routes with Next.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth v5 with credentials provider
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Deployment**: Prepared for potential deployment platforms

## Known Issues to Address
- Ensure consistent error handling throughout the application
- Implement form validations more thoroughly
- Set up proper data fetching patterns for subscriptions
- Need to finalize dashboard analytics components

The project has a solid foundation with working authentication and core UI components. We are now positioned to implement the main subscription management features in the next development session.
