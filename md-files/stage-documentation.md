# SubsTrack Development - Stage 3 Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details and progress made during Stage 3 of the SubsTrack subscription management application. Stage 3 focused on enhancing the backend functionality and data model, with a particular emphasis on adding lifetime purchase tracking alongside recurring subscriptions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Lifetime Purchase Tracking

- Added a new "LIFETIME" billing cycle option for one-time purchases
- Modified the subscription schema to make `nextBillingDate` optional for lifetime items
- Updated UI to display lifetime purchases differently from recurring subscriptions
- Added special badge and formatting for lifetime items in the subscription cards

### 2. Enhanced Data Model

- Converted string-based enum fields to proper TypeScript/Prisma enums:
  - `BillingCycleType` enum for subscription frequency
  - `SubscriptionStatus` enum for subscription state
- Added database indexes for better query performance
- Updated Prisma schema with proper relations
- Made schema changes to support NextAuth authentication

### 3. Backend Improvements

- Enhanced API endpoints to handle lifetime purchases
- Implemented proper type handling for enum values
- Added utility function for calculating next billing dates
- Fixed type issues in API routes and components
- Added separation of lifetime and recurring purchases in analytics calculations

### 4. UI Enhancements

- Updated subscription add/edit form to toggle fields based on purchase type
- Added dashboard metrics that separate lifetime and recurring costs
- Improved display of subscription details

## Key Technical Changes

### Schema Updates

```prisma
// Subscription model with lifetime support
model Subscription {
  id              String             @id @default(cuid())
  // ...other fields
  billingCycle    BillingCycleType
  nextBillingDate DateTime?          // Made optional for lifetime purchases
  // ...other fields
}

// Proper enum definitions
enum BillingCycleType {
  MONTHLY
  QUARTERLY
  BIANNUAL
  ANNUAL
  LIFETIME
  CUSTOM
}

enum SubscriptionStatus {
  ACTIVE
  PAUSED
  CANCELED
  TRIAL
}
```

### Utility Function

```typescript
// Function to calculate next billing date with lifetime support
export function calculateNextBillingDate(
  currentDate: Date,
  billingCycle: string
): Date | null {
  // Return null for lifetime purchases
  if (billingCycle === 'LIFETIME') {
    return null;
  }
  
  const nextDate = new Date(currentDate);
  
  switch (billingCycle) {
    case 'MONTHLY':
      nextDate.setMonth(nextDate.getMonth() + 1);
      break;
    // ...other cases
  }
  
  return nextDate;
}
```

### Dashboard Metrics

```typescript
// Separate recurring and lifetime calculations
const recurringSubscriptions = activeSubscriptions.filter(
  sub => sub.billingCycle !== 'LIFETIME'
);

const lifetimePurchases = activeSubscriptions.filter(
  sub => sub.billingCycle === 'LIFETIME'
);

// Calculate monthly costs from recurring subscriptions
const monthlyCost = recurringSubscriptions.reduce((total, sub) => {
  // ...calculation logic
}, 0);

// Calculate total lifetime purchase amount
const lifetimeTotal = lifetimePurchases.reduce((total, sub) => {
  return total + Number(sub.price);
}, 0);
```

## Database Management

- Successfully reset and migrated the database to support new schema changes
- Added proper enum types in the database
- Implemented nullable fields for lifetime purchases
- Added indexes for frequently queried fields

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Schema Migration**: Resolved issues with database schema drift by implementing a complete reset and rebuild approach
2. **Type Safety**: Ensured proper typing with enums throughout the application
3. **Conditional UI**: Implemented conditional form fields and display elements based on subscription type
4. **Data Calculations**: Modified analytics to properly account for lifetime purchases separately from recurring subscriptions

## Next Steps

As we move forward to Stage 4, the focus will be on:

1. Advanced analytics and visualization
2. Notification system for upcoming payments
3. Import/export functionality
4. Smart subscription recommendations
5. Further UI enhancements

## Conclusion

Stage 3 successfully expanded the core functionality of SubsTrack to handle both recurring subscriptions and lifetime purchases. The application now provides users with a more comprehensive way to track their digital spending across different payment models.

The backend improvements and data model enhancements provide a solid foundation for the advanced features planned in the upcoming stages of development.
